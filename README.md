# Cobalt
Cobalt is a project I'm currently working on to replicate and simulate a digital society and economy. 
I am by no means a professional, this is just something that I'm working on in my free time. It's more of a learning tool for myself than anything else.
If you have any questions or comments you can shoot me an email at: mrfantom7655@gmail.com
You're free to download this if you want but please do not distribute it to anyone else, Lead them to this git page.

# Installation Intructions

**New Installation**
-----------------------------------
You can find the downloads on the [realease](https://github.com/MrCryptoFantom/Cobalt/releases) page. Find the newest version and download the **"Cobalt.zip"** file. Once you've downloaded the .zip file, then extract it. Next you move that "Cobalt" folder to your desired directory. I recommend your (C:) Drive but the choice is yours!

**Updating Version**
-----------------------------------
All you'll need to do is find your version in the [realease](https://github.com/MrCryptoFantom/Cobalt/releases) page. Download the zip folder that looks similar to: **"project-cobalt.v0.0.5.Stable.zip"**. Extract the .zip folder, and take your newly extracted folder to your "**Cobalt/builds**" file on your PC (ex C:/Cobalt/builds).



# Current Features

- You can create a bot manually or run the simulation to- well simulate the society.
- Bots have random names from a database I, painfully, put together with over 100 first and last names(for now).
- Bots can also get married, for now each marriage is saved in a new folder to prevent replication of family names.
- I haven't added all the economic features yet. But bots can get jobs, earn money, pay taxes, etc. 
- View a bot at anytime either by visiting the files and manually openeing their .cbinfo files, or viewing them with the !view command in the console.
- Random news articles from the virtual day appear every once and a while. Each day is 10 seconds long and each year is a little over an hour, this too is hardcoded in   the game files for the time being.
- Bots can now own houses, if the male bot has a house when a marriage is initiated, the female with move her current house to his. All children produced from the marriage will also share the parents house.

I haven't finished project yet, I'm still polishing it up a bit more! I still have A LOT to do so don't judge this as the finished product just yet!

# Planned Features

- Fully functional Economy, aka an actual money pool all the bots pull from and contribute to so the money re-circulates.
- Customizable attributes such as day length, console color, custom names, starting money in the economy, and other attributes of the simulation.
- Age specific actions. i.e A 1 year old isn't going to "Be looking at colleges" lol.
- Some other random stuff that I'm gonna keep secret for the time, some of them are pretty interesting and I wouldn't want to spoil it!
